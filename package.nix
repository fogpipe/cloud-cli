# fpcloud — the Fogpipe Cloud CLI, distributed as a prebuilt proprietary binary.

# This single derivation is used two ways:
#   * flake.nix in this repo (so anyone can `nix run`/add it to their inputs), and
#   * a future nixpkgs submission (copy this to pkgs/by-name/fp/fpcloud/package.nix).
#
# The binary is closed-source, so this fetches the released artifact per platform
# rather than building from source (meta.license = unfree, sourceProvenance =
# binaryNativeCode). The packaging around it is MIT (see LICENSE).
